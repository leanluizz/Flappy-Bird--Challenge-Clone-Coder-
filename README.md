# Flappy-Bird-Clone

Introduction:

Flappy Bird is a popular game developed in 2013 by Vietnamese developer Dong Nguyen. In these documents, we are going to present a basic code for a Flappy Bird clone, developed in pure JavaScript.

Code structure:

The code for the Flappy Bird clone is relatively simple and consists of just a JavaScript file and an HTML file for the game page. on-screen, bird and obstacle movement, and collision detection.

Code working:

The code starts by creating a screen for the game within the HTML file. Then the JavaScript file defines the variables needed for the game, including the speed of the bird, the starting position of the bird and the width of the obstacles. Then the code creates the bird and obstacles on the screen and defines the logic for moving them.

The game starts when the user presses the space key, which causes the bird to start flying and obstacles start moving towards the bird. The user must use the space key to make the bird fly and avoid obstacles.

The code also includes collision detection, which checks to see if the bird has collided with an obstacle. If this happens, the game is over and a message is displayed on the screen.

Conclusion:

This code for a pure JavaScript Flappy Bird clone is a great way to learn the basics of JavaScript game development. The code is relatively simple and easy to understand, but it still offers a challenge for adoring gamers. With some modifications, this code can be expanded to include additional features such as more advanced graphics or more obstacles.
